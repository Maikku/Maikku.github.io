        <p>Hello! I'm Maikku, and I'm a passionate professional in the field of development with a solid experience in project work and process improvement. I was born on May xx, xxxx, in Jyv채skyl채, and I have always been motivated to learn and develop myself.</p>
        <p>I completed my degree in Hospitality Management at Jyv채skyl채 University of Applied Sciences in 2012. Additionally, I take pride in being a graduate of Voionmaa High School in 2005. My next goal is to complete a degree in Bachelor of Business Information Technology, and I have already begun my studies at Haaga-Helia Open University of Applied Sciences as part of my preparatory studies.</p>
        <p>As a development manager in the core system and process model project, I serve as the billing process owner, responsible for critical tasks such as defining target process models, requirements, and data migration coordination. I've also been involved in test planning and ensuring data quality for the system migration.</p>
        <p>As a trainer and key user in the maintenance and development of the ERP system, I played a pivotal role and was responsible for training and documentation. I actively participated in projects and contributed to the planning and testing of new system features.</p>
        <p>My leadership skills flourished as I managed a nationwide telephone customer service team. I gained valuable experience in recruitment, training, resource allocation, and project management.</p>
        <p>In addition to these experiences, I have acquired extensive knowledge in customer service, complaint handling, and contract management. I also have a strong background in upselling, which has added value to my work.</p>
